    printShortUsage "$1"
    echo
    cat <<HELPTEXT
    --print		Print the added filespecs.
    --bare		Do not print a status line before and after launching
			the COMMAND.
    --no-capture-output	By default, no status line is printed if the COMMAND did
			not have any output, and failing parallel invocations
			without output are ignored altogether. This option turns
			this off and will print status lines (and consider
			parallel failures) even without output. Some
			(interactive) commands (like Vim) do not like having
			their output not connected to the terminal, and can be
			made to cooperate by passing this option.
    --command|-c CMD	Execute CMD as a command-line. The string $fileMarker is
			replaced by the added filespecs. Multiple files (via
			--max-files) are passed as individual arguments.
    --prefix-command PC	Put PC (directly) in front of the COMMAND(s) given by
			(subsequent, but not previous) --command or
			SIMPLECOMMAND. This can be used to inject a wrapper
			command.
    --prefix-command-command PCC
			Put PCC (directly) in front of the COMMAND(s) given by
			(subsequent, but not previous) --command, and pass
			COMMAND via --command COMMAND to PCC. This can be used
			to inject a wrapper command that itself takes a
			--command argument.
			This is different than --prefix-command when COMMAND
			itself is a pipeline; here, the entire pipeline will be
			passed to PCC; whereas PC would only cover the first
			command inside the pipeline.
    --delay NUMBER[SUFFIX]
			Sleep for NUMBER[SUFFIX]] before executing COMMAND (to
			allow the file to stabilize, for example).
    --stabilization-time NUMBER[SUFFIX]
			Wait until NUMBER[SUFFIX] has passed (with a granularity
			of INTERVAL) after the last modification of the file
			before recognizing the change.
    --interval|-i INTERVAL[SUFFIX]
			Wait for INTERVAL seconds between observations of DIR.
			By default, any change is observed almost immediately.
    --max-files|-l N	A maximum of N (default: 1) files are consumed and
			passed to COMMAND at once (if available). The entire set
			of files counts as one change (for --count).
    --stop-on-empty|-S	Stop once DIR becomes empty / is deleted.
    --stop-on|-s PATTERN
			Stop observing if an added filename matches
			PATTERN. PATTERN is a Bash-style extended regular
			expression.
    --parallel		Instead of waiting for one COMMAND to finish before
			executing the next, run each one the moment the change
			is triggered. The default is sequential invocation.
    --rate-limit NUMBER[SUFFIX]]
			Sleep for NUMBER[SUFFIX]] before triggering the next
			parallel execution of COMMAND. This can avoid triggering
			too many simultaneous executions.
    --exit-on-success	Stop observing if COMMAND is successful.
    --exit-on-failure	Stop observing if COMMAND is unsuccessful.
    --exit-on NUM	Stop observing if COMMAND exits with NUM.
    --exit-unless NUM	Stop observing if COMMAND does not exit with NUM.
    --count|-n N	Stop observing after N additions.
    -1			Stop observing after the first added file.
    --delete-on-success	Delete the added file if COMMAND is successful.
    --delete-on-failure	Delete the added file if COMMAND is unsuccessful.
    --delete-on NUM	Delete the added file if COMMAND exits with NUM.
    --delete-unless NUM	Delete the added file if COMMAND does not exit with NUM.
Example:
HELPTEXT
    printf '%q %s\n' "$(basename "$1")" "--exec scp $fileMarker user@host:/tmp/ \; *.sh"
}
